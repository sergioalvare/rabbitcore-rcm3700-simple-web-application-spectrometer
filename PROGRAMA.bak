	This program is used with RCM3700 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates a basic controller running a
	WEB page. Two "device LED's" are created with two
	buttons to toggle	them.  Users can browse to the device
	and change the	status of the lights. The LED's on the
	prototyping	board will match the ones on the web page.

   This program is adapted from \Samples\TCPIP\ssi.c.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Make changes below in the configuration section to
	   match your application.
	2. Compile and run this program.
   3. With your WEB browser access the WEB page running on
   	the controller.
   4. View LEDS on Web page and the prototyping board to
   	see that	they match-up when changing them via the
   	WEB page	control button.
