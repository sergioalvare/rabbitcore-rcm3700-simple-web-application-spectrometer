<!-- this is the CANVAS element, which is available in browsers which
     conform to HTML 5.  There are other ways of generating graphics on
     web browsers, such as SVG and even having the Rabbit construct a
     PNG file, but none of these are as simple and convenient as this
     feature. -->

Sorry, your browser doesn't support canvas tag, so we can't show graphics :-(

<!-- the json() command sends an entire RabbitWeb root structure in one
     fell swoop, and it's in a format that JavaScript understands directly.
     Here, we send the "thermo" variable which contains everything necessary
     for generating the time series graph. -->
